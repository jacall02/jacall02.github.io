description: This project is my final degree thesis, an AI-powered tool for automatic music composition designed for video games. It enables game developers to create music for their games without any prior musical knowledge. I developed this alongside three classmates.

## Vanguard Music

This AI-Powered Music Composition Tool is an innovative solution designed to help video game developers generate unique yet cohesive soundtracks. Using machine learning algorithms for training, the tool creates melodies that are then processed in REAPER to produce a complete song tailored to the desired mood and intensity.

## Features

- **MIDI generation** based on various machine learning algorithms.
- **Automatic Harmonizing** using our own and unique heuristics.
- **Automatic Music Production** using reascript with Python in REAPER DAW.

## My work

My contributions to the project are:
- **Drum Machine** coded in Python to generate unique drum scores in MIDI.
- **Loading MIDI** in REAPER using reascript with Python.
- **Music Production** for the different genres and moods.
- **Background art** pre-rendered in 3D using Blender.
- **UI Design** and visual composition.
