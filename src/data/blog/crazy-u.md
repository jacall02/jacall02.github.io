## Crazy U

In this project we implemented our own 3D game engine and then developed a racing game, Crazy U. I did this alongside seven classmates.

## My work

My contributions to the project are:
- **Drum Machine** coded in Python to generate unique drum scores in MIDI.
- **Loading MIDI** in REAPER using reascript with Python.
- **Music Production** for the different genres and moods.
- **Background art** pre-rendered in 3D using Blender.
- **UI Design** and visual composition.
