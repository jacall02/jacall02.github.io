## No me juzgues

This game was made for a game jam. I made this alongside three classmates.

## Demonstration Video

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbrZ-IltzCE?si=77o6WGTlUbgBhPyU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## My work

My contributions to the project are:
- **Game design** of key aspects of the game.
- **2D art** of the game.
- **Music Production** and sound design.
- **Logo** and branding design for the game.
