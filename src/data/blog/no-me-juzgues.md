## No me juzgues

This game was made for a game jam. I made this alongside three classmates.

## Demonstration Video

## My work

My contributions to the project are:
- **Game design** of key aspects of the game.
- **Programming in C++** of various aspects of the game.
- **Custom particle system** using C++ and SDL.
- **2D art** of the game.
- **Music Production** and sound design.
- **Video filming** and editing.
- **Logo** and branding design for the game and company.
